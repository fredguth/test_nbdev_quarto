We even call our species *homo sapiens*, as intelligence was an intrinsic human characteristic.\n\nIn this dissertation:\n\n::: definition\n[**Intelligence**]{#def-intelligence label=\"def-intelligence\"} is the ability to predict a course of action to achieve success in specific goals.\n:::\n\n### Intelligent Agents\n\nUnder our generous definition, intelligence is not limited to humans. It applies to any agent[^2]: animal or machine. For example, a bacteria can perceive its environment through chemical signals, process them, and then produce chemicals to signal other bacteria. An air-conditioning can observe temperature changes, know its state, and adapt its functioning, turning off if it is cold or on if it is hot --- *intelligence exempts understanding*. The air-conditioning does not comprehend what it is doing. The same way a calculator does not know arithmetics.\n\n### A strange inversion of reasoning\n\nThis competence without comprehension is what the philosopher Daniel Dennett calls *Turing's strange inversion of reasoning*[^3][]{#turing_strange_inversion label=\"turing_strange_inversion\"}. The idea of a *strange inversion* comes from one of Darwin's 19^th^-century critics (@mackenzie:1868 as cited by @dennett:2009):\n\n> *In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer; so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system, that, **in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine, it is not requisite to know how to make it**. This proposition will be found, on careful examination, to express, in condensed form, the essential purport of the \\[Evolution\\] Theory, and to express in a few words all Mr Darwin's meaning; who, by **a strange inversion of reasoning**, seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in all of the achievements of creative skill.* --- Robert MacKenzie\\\n\nCounterintuitively to @mackenzie:1868 and many others to this date, intelligence can emerge from absolute ignorance. Turing's strange inversion of reasoning comes from the realisation that his automata can perform calculations by symbol manipulation, proving that it is possible to build agents that behave intelligently, even if they are entirely ignorant of the meaning of what they are doing [@turing:2007].\n\n## Dreaming of robots\n\n### From mythology to Logic\n\nThe idea of creating an intelligent agent is perhaps as old as humans. There are accounts of artificial intelligence in almost any ancient mythology: Greek, Etruscan, Egyptian, Hindu, Chinese [@mayor:2018]. For example, in Greek mythology, the story of the bronze automaton of Talos built by Hephaestus, the god of invention and blacksmithing, first mentioned around 700 BC.\n\nThis interest may explain why, since ancient times, philosophers have looked for *mechanical* methods of reasoning. Chinese, Indian and Greek philosophers all developed formal deduction in the first millennium BC.In particular, Aristotelian syllogism, *laws of thought*, provided patterns for argument structures to yield irrefutable conclusions, given correct premises. These ancient developments were the beginning of the field we now call *Logic*.\n\n### Rationalism: The Cartesian view of Nature {#sec-rationalism}\n\n![Example of one of Lull’s Ars Magna’s paper discs.](imgs/ars_magna_disc.png){.column-margin #fig-ars_magna_disc label=\"fig-ars_magna_disc\"}\n\nIn the 13^th^ century, the Catalan philosopher Ramon Lull wanted to produce all statements the human mind can think. For this task, he developed *logic paper machines*, discs of paper filled with esoteric coloured diagrams that connected symbols representing statements. Unfortunately, according to @gardner:1959, in a modern reassessment of his work, *\"it is impossible, perhaps, to avoid a strong sense of anticlimax\"* [@gardner:1959]. With megalomaniac self-esteem that suggests psychosis, his delusional sense of importance is more characteristic of cult founders. On the bright side, his ideas and books exerted some magic appeal that helped them be rapidly disseminated through all Europe [@gardner:1959].\n\n\nLull's work greatly influenced Leibniz and Descartes, who, in the 17^th^century, believed that all rational thought could be mechanised. This belief was the basis of **rationalism**, the epistemic view of the *Enlightenment* that regarded reason as the sole source of knowledge. In other words, they believed that reality has a logical structure and that certain truths are *self-evident*, and all truths can be derived from them.\n\nThere was considerable interest in developing artificial languages during this period. Nowadays, they are called formal languages.\n\n> *If controversies were to arise, there would be no more need for disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants. For it would suffice to take their pencils in their hands, to sit down to their slates, and to say to each other: **Let us calculate.*** --- Gottfried Leibniz\n\nThe rationalist view of the world has had an enduring impact on society until today. In the 19^th^century, George Boole and others developed a precise notation for statements about all kinds of objects in Nature and their relations. Before them, Logic was philosophical rather than mathematical. The name of Boole's masterpiece, *\"The Laws of Thought\"*, is an excellent indicator of his Cartesian worldview.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20^th^ century, some of the most famous mathematicians, David Hilbert, Bertrand Russel, Alfred Whitehead, were still interested in formalism: they wanted mathematics to be formulated on a solid and complete logical foundation. In particular, Hilbert's *Entscheidungs Problem* (decision problem) asked if there were limits to mechanical Logic proofs [@chaitin:2006].\n\nKurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem (1931) proved that any language expressive enough to describe arithmetics of the natural numbers is either incomplete or inconsistent. This theorem imposes a limit on logic systems. There will always be truths that will not be provable from within such languages: there are \"true\" statements that are undecidable.\n\nAlan Turing brought a new perspective to the *Entscheidungs Problem*: a function on natural numbers that an algorithm in a formal language cannot represent cannot be computable [@chaitin:2006]. Gödel's limit appears in this context as functions that are not computable,  no algorithm can decide whether another algorithm will stop or not (the halting problem). To prove that, Turing developed a whole new general theory of computation: what is computable and how to compute it, laying out a blueprint to build computers, and making possible Artificial Intelligence research as we know it. An area in which Turing himself was very much invested.\n\n### Empiricism: The sceptical view of Nature {#sec-empiricism}\n\n\n![David Hume, Scottish Enlightenment philosopher, historian, economist, librarian and essayist.](imgs/hume.png){#fig-hume .column-margin}\n\nThe response to **rationalism** was **empiricism**, the epistemological view that knowledge comes from sensory experience, our perceptions of the world. Locke explains this with the peripatetic axiom[^4]: *\"there is nothing in the intellect that was not previously in the senses\"* [@williams:2020]. Bacon, Locke and Hume were great exponents of this movement, which established the grounds of the scientific method.\n\nDavid Hume, in particular, presented in the 18^th^ century a radical empiricist view: reason only does not lead to knowledge. In [@hume:2009], Hume distinguishes *relations of ideas*, propositions that derive from deduction and *matters of facts*, which rely on the connection of cause and effect through experience (induction). Hume's critiques, known as *the Problem of Induction*, added a new slant on the debate of the emerging scientific method.\n\nFrom Hume's own words:\n\n> *The bread, which I formerly eat, nourished me; that is, a body of such sensible qualities was, at that time, endued with such secret powers: but does it follow, that other bread must also nourish me at another time, and that like sensible qualities must always be attended with like secret powers? The consequence seems nowise necessary.* --- David Hume\n\nThere is no logic to deduce that the future will resemble the past. Still, we expect uniformity in Nature. As we see more examples of something happening, it is *wise* to expect that it will happen in the future just as it did in the past. There is, however, no *rationality*[^5] in this expectation.\n\nHume explains that we see conjunction repeatedly, \"bread\" and \"nourish\", and we expect *uniformity in Nature*; we hope that \"nourish\" will always follow \"eating bread\"; When we fulfil this expectancy, we misinterpret it as causation. In other words, we *project* causation into phenomena. Hume explained that this connection does not exist in Nature. We do not \"see causation\"; we create it.\n\nThis projection is *Hume's strange inversion of reasoning* [@huebner:2017]: We do not like sugar because it is sweet; sweetness exists because we like (or need) it. There is no sweetness in honey.[]{#honey label=\"honey\"} We wire our brain so that glucose triggers a labelled desire we call sweetness. As we will see later, sweetness is *information*. This insight shows the pattern matching nature of humans. Musicians have relied on this for centuries. Music is a sequence of sounds in which we expect a pattern. The expectancy is the tension we feel while the chords progress. When the progression finally *resolves*, forming a pattern, we release the tension. We feel pattern matching in our core. It is very human, it can be beneficial and wise, but it is, *stricto sensu*, *irrational*.\n\nThe epistemology of the sceptical view of Nature is science: to weigh one's beliefs to the evidence. Knowledge is not absolute truth but justified belief. It is a Babylonian epistemology.\n\nIn rationalism, Logic connects knowledge and good actions. In empiricism, the connection between knowledge and justifiable actions is determined by probability. More specifically, Bayes' theorem. As Jaynes puts it, probability theory is the \"Logic of Science\" . [^6]\n\n### The birth of AI as a research field\n\n\n![Claude Shannon, father of “information theory”.](imgs/shannon.png){#fig-shannon .column-margin}\n\n\nIn 1943, McCulloch and Pitts, a neurophysiologist and a logician, demonstrated that neuron-like electronic units could be wired together, act and interact by physiologically plausible principles and perform complex logical calculations [@russell:2010]. Moreover, they showed that any computable function could be computed by some network of connected neurons [@mcculloch:1943]. Their work marks the birth of [ANNs]{acronym-label=\"ANN\" acronym-form=\"plural+full\"}, even before the field of AI had this name. It was also the birth of **Connectionism**, using artificial neural networks, loosely inspired by biology, to explain mental phenomena and imitate intelligence.\n\nTheir work inspired John von Neumann's demonstration of how to create a universal Turing machine out of electronic components, which lead to the advent of computers and programming languages. Ironically, these advents hastened the ascent of the formal logicist approach called **Symbolism**, disregarding Connectionism.\n\nIn 1956, John McCarthy, [Claude Shannon][1], Marvin Minsky and Nathaniel Rochester organised a 2-month summer workshop in Dartmouth College to bring researchers of different fields concerned with *\"thinking machines\"* (cybernetics, information theory, automata theory). The workshop attendees became a community of researchers and chose the term *\"artificial intelligence\"* for the field.\n\n::: fullwidth\n![The Blind Men and the Elephant.](imgs/elephant.png)\n\n> *\\\n> It was six men of Indostan\\\n> To learning much inclined,\\\n> Who went to see the Elephant\\\n> (Though all of them were blind),\\\n> That each by observation\\\n> Might satisfy his mind\\\n> ---John Godfrey Saxe,\\\n>  \\\n> The Blind Men and the Elephant []{#blind_men label=\"blind_men\"}\\\n> *\n:::\n\n## Building Intelligent Agents\n\n### Anatomy of intelligent agents {#sec-anatomy_ia}\n\nLike the blind men in the parable, an intelligent agent shall model her understanding of Nature from limited sensory data.\n\n\n![Anatomy of an Intelligent Agent. Inspired by art in (@russell:2010)](imgs/anatomy.png){#fig-anatomy width=60% fig-align=\"center\" .column-body}\n\nThus, an agent perceives her environment with sensors, treat sensory data as facts and use these facts to possibly update her model of Nature, use the model to decide her actions, and acts via her actuators. In a way, agents continually communicate with Nature in a perception/action conversation ([\\[fig-anatomy\\]][2]).\n\nThe expected result of this conversation is a change in the agent's [KB]{acronym-label=\"KB\" acronym-form=\"singular+full\"}, therefore in her model and, more importantly, her future decisions. The model is an abstraction of how the agent \"thinks\" the world is (her \"mental picture\" of the environment). Therefore, it should be consistent with it: if something is true in Nature, it is equally valid, *mutatis mutandis*, in the model. A Model should also be as simple as possible so that the agent can make decisions that maximise a chosen performance measure, but not simpler. As the agent knows more about Nature, less it gets surprised by it.\n\nThis rudimentary anatomy is flexible enough to entail different epistemic views, like the rationalist (mathematical) and the empiricist (scientific); different approaches to how to implement the knowledge base (it can be learned, therefore updatable, or it can be set in stone from an expert prior knowledge); and also from how to implement it (a robot or software).\n\nNoteworthy, though, is that the model that transforms input data into decisions should be the target of our focus.\n\n### Symbolism\n\nSymbolism is the pinnacle of rationalism. In the words of Thomas Hobbes, one of the forerunners of rationalism, *\"thinking is the manipulation of symbols and reasoning is computation\".* Symbolism is the approach to building intelligent agents that does just that. It attempts to represent knowledge with a formal language and explicitly connects the knowledge with actions. It is *competence from comprehension*. In other words, it is *programmed*.\n\nEven though McCulloch and Pitts work on artificial neural networks predates Von Neumann's computers, Symbolism dominated [AI]{acronym-label=\"AI\" acronym-form=\"singular+short\"} until the $1980$s. It was so ubiquitous that symbolic [AI]{acronym-label=\"AI\" acronym-form=\"singular+short\"} is even called \"good old fashioned AI\" [@russell:2010].\n\nThe symbolic approach can be traced back to Nichomachean Ethics [@aristotle:2000]:\n\n> *We deliberate not about ends but means. For a doctor does not deliberate whether he shall heal, nor an orator whether he shall persuade, nor a statesman whether he shall produce law and order, nor does anyone else deliberate about his end. They assume the end and consider how and by what means it is to be attained; and if it seems to be produced by several means, they consider by which it is most easily and best produced, while if it is achieved by one only they consider how it will be achieved by this and by what means this will be achieved, till they come to the first cause, which in the order of discovery is last.*\n>\n> --- Aristotle \n\nThis perspective is so entrenched that @russell:2010 [p. 7] still says: *\"($\\ldots$) Only by understanding how actions can be justified can we understand how to build an agent whose actions are justifiable\"*; even though, in the same book, they cover machine learning (which we will address later in this chapter) without noticing it is proof that there are other ways to build intelligent agents. Moreover, it is also a negation of competence without comprehension. It seems that even for AI researchers, the strange inversion of reasoning is uncomfortable ([\\[ch:introduction\\]][3]).\n\nAll humans, even those in prisons and under mental health care, think their actions are justifiable. Is that not an indication that we rationalise our actions *ex post facto*? We humans tend to think our rational assessments lead to actions, but it is also likely possible that we act and then rationalise afterwards to justify what we have done, fullheartedly believing that the rationalisation came first.\n\n#### Claude Shannon's Theseus\n\nAfter writing what is probably the most important master's dissertation of the 20^th^ century and \"inventing\" [IT]{acronym-label=\"IT\" acronym-form=\"singular+long\"}, what made possible the Information Age we live in today, Claude Shannon enjoyed the freedom to pursue any interest to which his curious mind led him [@soni:2017]. In the $1950$s, his interest shifted to building artificial intelligence. He was not a typical academic, in any case. A lifelong tinkerer, he liked to \"think\" with his hand as much as with his mind. Besides developing an algorithm to play chess (when he even did not have a computer to run it), one of his most outstanding achievements in AI was Theseus, a robotic maze-solving mouse.[^7]\n\nTo be more accurate, Theseus was just a bar magnet covered with a sculpted wooden mouse with copper whiskers; the maze was the \"brain\" that solved itself [@klein:2018].\n\n> *\"Under the maze, an electromagnet mounted on a motor-­powered carriage can move north, south, east, and west; as it moves, so does Theseus. Each time its copper whiskers touch one of the metal walls and complete the electric circuit, two things happen. First, the corresponding relay circuit's switch flips from \"on\" to \"off,\" recording that space as having a wall on that side. Then Theseus rotates $90^{\\circ}$ clockwise and moves forward. In this way, it systematically moves through the maze until it reaches the target, recording the exits and walls for each square it passes through.\" --- @klein:2018*.\n\n#### Symbolic AI problems\n\nSeveral symbolic AI projects sought to hard-code knowledge about domains in formal languages, but it has always been a costly, slow process that could not scale.\n\nAnyhow, by $1965$, there were already programs that could solve any solvable problem described in logical notation [@russell:2010 p.4]. However, hubris and lack of philosophical perspective made computer scientists believe that \"intelligence was a problem about to be solved[^8].\"\n\nThose inflated expectations lead to disillusionment and funding cuts[^9] [@russell:2010]. They failed to estimate the inherent difficulty in slating informal knowledge in formal terms: the world has many shades of grey. Besides, complexity theory had yet to be developed: they did not count on the exponential explosion of their problems.\n\n### Connectionism: a different approach\n\nThe fundamental idea in Connectionism is that **intelligent behaviour emerges from a large number of simple computational units when networked together** [@goodfellow:2016].\n\nIt was pioneered by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943 [@mcculloch:1943]. One of Connectionism's first wave developments was Frank Rosenblatt's Perceptron, an algorithm for learning binary classifiers, or more specifically threshold functions: $$\\begin{aligned}\n    y=\n    \\begin{cases}\n        1 \\text{ if } \\mW\\vx + \\vb > 0\\\\\n        0 \\text{ otherwise }\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\mW$ is the vector of weights, $\\vx$ is the input vector, $\\vb$ is a bias, and $\\vy$ is the classification. In neural networks, a perceptron is an artificial neuron using a step function as the activation function.\n\n::: {.column-page-left layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n![Building in Harare, Zimbabwe, modelled after termite mounds.

Photo by Awoisoak Kaosiowa, 2008.](imgs/termite_cathedral.jpg){#fig-termite_cathedral width=\"250px\"}\n\n\nBiomimicry of termite technique achieves superior energy efficiency in buildings.\n:::\n\nSee [\\[fig-termite_cathedral\\]][4], termites self-cooling mounds keep the temperature inside at exactly $31^{\\circ} C$, ideal for their fungus-farming; while the temperatures outside range from 2 to $40^{\\circ} C$ throughout the day. Such building techniques inspired architect Mike Pearce to design a shopping mall that uses a tenth of the energy used by a conventional building of the same size.\n\nFrom where does termites intelligence come?\n\n> *Individual termites react rather than think, but at a group level, they exhibit a kind of cognition and awareness of their surroundings. Similarly, in the brain, individual neurons do not think, but thinking arises in their connections.* --- Radhika Nagpal, Harvard University [@margonelli:2016].\n\nSuch collective intelligence happens in groups of just a couple of million termites. There are around 80 to 90 billion neurons in the human brain, each less capable than a termite, but collectively they show incomparable intelligence capabilities.\n\n![A brief history of connectionism. Adapted from (@tishby:2020DeepMath).](imgs/winters.png){#fig-connectionism width=80%}\n\nIn contrast with the symbolic approach, in neural networks, the knowledge is not explicit in symbols but implicit in the strength of the connections between the neurons. Besides, it is a very general and flexible approach since these connections can be updated algorithmically: they are algorithms that *learn*: the connectionist approach is an example of what we now call Machine Learning.\n\n### Machine Learning\n\n![Is this a cat?](imgs/lulu.png){#fig-lulu .column-margin}\n\nLook at [\\[fig-lulu\\]][5]. Is this a picture of a cat? How to write a program to do such a simple classification task (cat/no cat)? One could develop clever ways to use *features* from the input picture and process them to guess. Though, it is not an easy program to design. Worse, even if one manages to program such a task, how much would it worth to accomplish a related *task*, to recognise a dog, for example? For long, this was the problem of researchers in many areas of interest of AI:[CV]{acronym-label=\"CV\" acronym-form=\"singular+full\"}, [NLP]{acronym-label=\"NLP\" acronym-form=\"singular+full\"}, Speech Recognition [SR]{acronym-label=\"SR\" acronym-form=\"singular+short\"}; much mental effort was put, with inferior results, in problems that we humans solve with apparent ease.\n\nThe solution is an entirely different approach for building artificial intelligence: instead of making the program do the *task*, build the program that outputs the program that does the *task*. In other words, learning algorithms use \"training data\" to infer the transformations to the input that generates the desired output.\n\n#### Types of learning\n\nMachine Learning can happen in different scenarios, which differ in the availability of training data, how training data is received, and how the test data is used to evaluate the learning. Here, we describe the most typical of them [@mohri:2012]:\n\n-   **Supervised learning:** The most successful scenario. The learner receives a set of labelled examples as training data and makes predictions for unseen data.\n\n-   **Unsupervised learning:** The learner receives unlabelled training data and makes predictions for unseen instances.\n\n-   **Semi-supervised learning:** The learner receives a training sample consisting of labelled and unlabelled data and makes predictions for unseen examples. Semi-supervised learning is usual in settings where unlabelled data is easily accessible, but labelling is too costly.\n\n-   **Reinforcement learning:** The learner actively interacts with the environment and receives an immediate reward for her actions. The training and testing phases are intermixed.\n\n### Deep Learning\n\nThe $2010$s have been an AI Renaissance not only in academia but also in the industry. Such successes are mostly due to [DL]{acronym-label=\"DL\" acronym-form=\"singular+full\"}, in particular, supervised deep learning with vast amounts of data trained in [GPUs]{acronym-label=\"GPU\" acronym-form=\"plural+full\"}. It was the decade of [DL]{acronym-label=\"DL\" acronym-form=\"singular+short\"}.\n\n> *\"Deep learning algorithms seek to exploit the unknown structure in the input distribution to discover good representations, often at multiple levels, with higher-level learned features defined in terms of lower-level features.\" --- Joshua Bengio [@bengio:2012]*\n\nThe name is explained by  @goodfellow:2016: \"*A graph showing the concepts being built on top of each other is a deep graph. Therefore the name, deep learning*\" [@goodfellow:2016]. Although it is a direct descendant of the connectionist movement, it goes beyond the neuroscientific perspective in its modern form. It is more a general principle of learning multiple levels of compositions.\n\nThe quintessential example of a deep learning model is the deep feedforward network or [MLP]{acronym-label=\"MLP\" acronym-form=\"singular+full\"} [@russell:2010].\n\n::: definition\nLet,\n\n-   be the input vector $\\{\\vx_1, \\ldots, \\vx_m\\}$\n\n-   be the layer index, such that $k \\in [1,l]$,\n\n-   be the matrix of weights in the $k$-th layer, where $i \\in [0,d_{k-1}], j \\in [1, d_k] \\text{ and }\\mW^{(k)}_{0,:}$ are the biases\n\n-   be a nonlinear function,\n\na **[MLPs]{acronym-label=\"MLP\" acronym-form=\"plural+full\"}** is a neural network where the input is defined by: $$\\begin{aligned}\n        h^{(0)}= 1^\\frown \\vx,\n    \n\\end{aligned}$$ a hidden layer is defined by: $$\\begin{aligned}\n        h^{(k)}&=\\sigma^{(k)}(\\mW^{(k)~\\top} h^{(k-1)}).\n    \n\\end{aligned}$$ The output is defined by: $$\\begin{aligned}\n        \\hat{y}&=h^{(l)}.\n    \n\\end{aligned}$$\n:::\n\nDeep Learning is usually associated with [DNNs]{acronym-label=\"DNN\" acronym-form=\"plural+full\"}, but the network architecture is only one of its components:\n\n1.  DNN architecture\n\n2.  [SGD]{acronym-label=\"SGD\" acronym-form=\"singular+full\"} --- the optimiser\n\n3.  Dataset\n\n4.  Loss function\n\nThe architecture is not the sole component essential to current Deep Learning success. The [SGD]{acronym-label=\"SGD\" acronym-form=\"singular+short\"} plays a crucial role, and so does the usage of large datasets.\n\nA known problem, though, is that DNNs are prone to overfitting ([\\[sec-bias-variance\\]][6]).  @zhang:2016 show state-of-the-art convolutional deep neural networks can easily fit a random labelling of training data [@zhang:2016].\n\n## Concluding Remarks\n\nThis chapter derived the need for a *language* from the definitions of *intelligence* and *intelligent agents*. An intelligent agent needs *language* to store her knowledge (what she has learned) and with that to communicate/share this knowledge with its future self and with other agents.\n\nWe claim (without proving) that a language can be derived from a definition of knowledge: an epistemic choice. We claim that mathematics and science can be seen as languages that differ in consequence of different views on what knowledge is and gave historical background on two epistemic views, Rationalism and Empiricism ([\\[sec-rationalism,sec-empiricism\\]][7]).\n\nWe gave historical background on [AI]{acronym-label=\"AI\" acronym-form=\"singular+full\"} and showed that different epistemic views relate to [AI]{acronym-label=\"AI\" acronym-form=\"singular+short\"} movements: Symbolism and Connectionism. We gave some background on basic [AI]{acronym-label=\"AI\" acronym-form=\"singular+short\"} concepts: intelligent agents, machine learning, types of learning, neural networks and deep learning, showing that [DL]{acronym-label=\"DL\" acronym-form=\"singular+short\"} relates to Connectionism and, hence, to science and an empiricist epistemology. Previously ([\\[sec-bringing_science\\]][8]), we have discussed that Computer Science generally relates to the rationalist epistemology. We hope this can help us better understand our research community.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n1.  A definition of intelligence ([\\[def-intelligence\\]][9])\n\n2.
